    A Windows-specific class that temporarily sets the DPI awareness context of
    the current thread to be DPI unaware and resets it to the previous context
    when it goes out of scope.

    If you create one of these before creating a top-level window, the window
    will be DPI unaware and bitmap stretched by the OS on a display with >100%
    scaling.

    You shouldn't use this unless you really know what you are doing and
    are dealing with native HWNDs.
